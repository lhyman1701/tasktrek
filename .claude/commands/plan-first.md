# Plan First Command

You are now entering **PLAN MODE**. Before writing ANY code or making ANY file changes:

## Planning Requirements

1. **Analyze Existing Codebase**
   - Find 2-3 similar implementations in the project
   - Identify patterns and conventions being used
   - Note relevant files and their purposes

2. **Create Detailed Plan**
   - Break work into atomic, testable steps
   - List ALL files that will be modified/created
   - Identify dependencies between steps
   - Specify test approach for each step

3. **Risk Assessment**
   - List potential issues or edge cases
   - Identify assumptions being made
   - Note areas of uncertainty

4. **Present Plan for Approval**
   - Show complete plan with numbered steps
   - Wait for explicit user approval
   - Do NOT proceed without approval

## Remember
- Each step should be independently testable
- Steps should be small (5-15 minutes each)
- Include test creation in steps
- Plan must be complete before ANY tool execution

After approval, implement ONE step at a time, waiting for review between steps.
