# Create Task Command

## Task Creation Workflow

1. **Gather Requirements**
   - Ask clarifying questions about the feature/fix
   - Understand business value and priority
   - Identify technical constraints

2. **Update ROADMAP**
   - Add high-level task summary to `reference/ROADMAP.md`
   - Assign appropriate priority (High/Medium/Low)
   - Note any dependencies

3. **Create Detailed Task File**
   - Use `tasks/000-template.md` as starting point
   - Generate next task number (increment from last)
   - Fill in ALL sections completely:
     - Clear overview with current/target state
     - Detailed implementation steps (5-8 steps ideal)
     - Specific files to modify per step
     - Acceptance criteria (functional + technical)
     - Dependencies and blockers

4. **Review Before Implementation**
   - Show the completed task file
   - Confirm all sections are filled
   - Wait for approval before starting work

The task file is your contract. Follow it precisely during implementation.
